## The Flow

We follow The Git Flow.

You can read about it in details [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

### Branching Rules

* features are being developed in a separate branches derived from `develop`
* hotfixes are being developed in a separate branches derived from `master`
* tags are being used when a release is made
* **any** merge into `master` and `develop` must be done with a Pull Request

## Committing

You can read about the topic [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### Committing Rules

* the first word of a commit message must start with a Capital
* the length of the subject line should be near 50 symbols
* use the imperative mood in the subject line
* the period at the end of the subject line is prohibited
* `exception` it is considered `ok` to have more than one commit with the same subject line (repeatable commits within the same task)

The correct subject line of a commit message must complete the following sentence:

> If applied, this commit will _your subject line here_

**The Correct Example**:

> If applied, this commit will _Refactor subsystem X for readability_

**The INCORRECT Example**:

> If applicaed, this commit will _fixed bug with Y_

Or

> If applied, this commit will _changing behavior of Z_
